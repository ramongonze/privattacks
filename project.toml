description = "Privattacks is a Python package for evaluating privacy risks in tabular datasets. It provides tools to quantify re-identification and attribute inference vulnerabilities based on combinations of quasi-identifiers an adversary knows about a target. The package supports both high-level and granular analysis, including per-record vulnerability distributions, multiprocessing for efficiency, and flexible input handling via pandas DataFrames and other sources."
